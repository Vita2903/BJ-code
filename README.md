# Initiation of Epithelial Wound Closure Simulations

## Description
This repository contains code for simulations related to the article submitted to the *Biophysical Journal* titled **"Initiation of Epithelial Wound Closure by an Active Instability at the Purse String."** 

## Repository Structure
This repository includes the following subfolders:

### `1_initial_samples`
Prepares tissue samples with a circular wound using periodic boundary conditions.

### `2_elastic_energy`
Studies the elastic modulus \(k_2\) as it relates to parameters \(k_A\) and \(p_0\) by varying the radius of the wound.

### `3_dynamics`
Simulates the dynamics of wound stability under various parameters to determine whether the wound closes or remains open.

### `4_fast_slow`
Explores the fast and slow phases of wound closure, incorporating fluctuating junctional tensions due to stochasticity of myosin turnover and cell growth in the bulk.
